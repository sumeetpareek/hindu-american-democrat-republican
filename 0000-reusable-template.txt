PURPOSE OF THIS FILE
======

This simple text file is to help me with video editing of reusable parts of the
series **Hindu American Trump Tiktok Theory**. The goal of this series is to
make a total of 1461 videos, and the thought behind it can be read here:

I have severe ADHD which I wish to channel productively, instead of it being an
impediment, and it helps to have a text file such as this one, where I can 
scribble from time to time, whenever I get anxious or feel an urge to distract
myself. This text file also serves as a rudimentary organization tool, that
helps me go from a scattered mind full of ideas to an actual finished video.
