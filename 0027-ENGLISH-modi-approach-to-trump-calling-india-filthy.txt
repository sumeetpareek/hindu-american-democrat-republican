PURPOSE OF THIS FILE
======
This simple text file is to help me with video editing of `part 0027` of the
series **HINDU AMERICAN 60% REPUBLICAN TIKTOK THEORY**. The goal of this series 
is to make a total of 1461 multilingual videos, in over 10 Indian languages,
and the thought behind it can be read here:

https://simpleandaudacious.com/hindu-american-trump-tiktok-theory/

I have severe ADHD which I wish to channel productively, instead of it being an
impediment, and it helps to have a text file such as this one, where I can 
scribble from time to time, whenever I get anxious or feel an urge to distract
myself. 

This text file also serves as a rudimentary organization tool, that
helps me go from a scattered mind full of ideas, to an actual finished video.

in the context of pollution

2. what young hindu americans on twitter 
do not know about modi ji's approach to life 
and his ahead of target clean energy work

what gen-z folks also call pressing guys

4. what is the dharma of balance?
